# Lead Scoring with Machine Learning for X Education
## Overview:-
This project develops a machine learning model using logistic regression to score leads for X Education. 
## Feature Engineering:-
Created dummy variables for categorical attributes and selected relevant features using RFE and VIF.
## Model Building:-
Built a logistic regression model to predict lead conversion probability.
Evaluated the model using confusion matrix, ROC curve, precision, and recall.
## Conclusion:-
This model helps X Education prioritize leads likely to convert into paying customers and make data-driven decisions to enhance lead conversion rates.
